# The Maker Skill Trees Project 


![Maker Skill Tree Banner-48](https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree/assets/7828884/53d12889-fc08-4b32-92b6-d96271200a7e)

Maker Skill Trees are printable templates that can you can use to visualize your skill progress, identify skill gaps and get inspired to try new things. Get a quick intro on the project with this video:

[<img width="809" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fad59d67-efe6-4673-8cd4-b4f2895e9792" />](https://youtu.be/D98e5UBU1Wg?si=HDqiQfWYFtq8v_FZ)

Each skill tree has 73 skill or experience hexagonal tiles, ordered in a spectrum of basic skills at the bottom to more advanced skills at the top. Color in the boxes as you go, starting at the base in the basics and moving to advanced skills at the top. This repository is always growing and aims to include a large variety of skills, see full list below.   Everyone's journey is different and you can interpret the goals flexibly. This project is collaborative and aims to refine and grow these resources through community involvement.

# How to use

Print out your chosen template or use the template digitally. Start at the base and color in the boxes of anything you've already done. Use the template to visualise your current skills and identify any skill gaps. You may wish to use the below coloring convention to tailor the tree to your own journey, and there are sticker templates available (under templates folder) if you wish to make goal replacement stickers on a vinyl cutter.  Think of the tiles as suggestions that can be changed based on your priorities and ability.  Skill trees do not need to be completed to 100%, let it help you map your progress so far and plan your future learning journey.  Tiles can be completed out of order, but if you're a beginner, best start at the base in the basics.

# Skill Tree Generator
You can now make your own skill tree templates with the [Skill Tree Generator](https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTree-Generator/) designed by the talented [@schme16](https://github.com/schme16).  It's now a lot easier to make your own templates for personal use or adding to the repository.

How to use:
* Heading text is editable
* Click and drag to move the tiles
* Right click a tile to edit the text
* Save will download an SVG of the skill tree
* Left click to edit credit at the base to add your own name, or remove my name if you're just using for personal use (or don't want me to proof read/edit it). 

# Usage Ideas

- Individual goal tracking and upskilling, identifying skill gaps  #skilltreechallenge
- For makerspace members to upskill on a variety of tools
- For training new staff members on skills
- For school students working on self-directed activities (See Kids STEAM Skills tree)
- For recruitment, competency checking, careers counselling or coaching

It's encouraged to customize these base skill trees around your own interests and goals.  You may edit these PDFs to suit or use tile stickers to cover the boxes on a printed template.  You can cut your own tile stickers with a vinyl cutter using the Tile Stickers Template SVG (in the templates folder).  

# SVG to YAML

If you'd like to create machine readable YAML files from [Maker Skill Tree Generator](https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTree-Generator/) generated SVG files or vice versa, this [Skill Tree Tool](https://josephlewis42.github.io/skilltreetool/#) developed by  [@josephlewis42](https://github.com/josephlewis42/skilltreetool) can help.  It's also got a useful changelog generator built in too which can show the changes made during peer review between an old skill tree and a refreshed one.

# FAQ

**Were these made with AI?**           
No, these were made in collaboration with experts or using my own expertise, without any AI usage, and the aim of this project is to rely on human expertise.  You can see the author credits at the base of each tree. Every expert has different experiences and I'm delighted to build a community on here for experts contribute.  Peer review contributions are key to this process to polish the templates into their best versions. If you're interested in contributing, check out the (Project Wiki)[https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree/wiki] with guidance and available contributor rewards.

**Will you keep the 'Skill Trees' name when they aren't really traditional skill trees?**               
While these templates are skill tree inspired, I realise they are not made up of connected nodes like traditional skill trees.  However, many games, like Borderlands, Starfield and others also have skill systems without connected nodes that still use the skill tree name. I have decided to keep the name 'Skill Trees' to make the concept easier to understand at a glance.

**Are you interested in making more books with different skills?**   
Yes, I've now released (Skill Seeker: Maker Edition)[https://www.amazon.com.au/Skill-Seeker-Practical-Growth-Skills/dp/1680458574/ref=sr_1_1] for adults, and (Skill Seeker: Young Maker Edition)[https://www.amazon.com.au/Skill-Seeker-Young-Steph-Piper/dp/1680458728/ref=sr_1_2] for 8-12 year olds.  I'd like to work on a generalist 'Life Skills' book in 2026, which would include skills like Cooking, Cleaning, Gardening, Finance, Self Care and more.   

**Are you going to make a web app of this system?**   
Not in the short term, but if you're interested in using the project for a skill tracking software you can unlock a software dev licence by sponsoring this project.
